							<p>This is going to be a rather lengthy wall of text. However, if you're interested in our services for Warlords of Draenor I suggest you read it in it's entirety.</p>
				<p>Here's why:</p>
				
				<h4>History</h4>
				<p>We began our challenge mode sales in the beginning of January 2013, and haven't stopped since. This is our full time job. We spend well over 40 hours per week handling inquiries, doing runs, and other various tasks to keep our business running smoothly. At the time of this writing we have successfully completed over <b>1300 unique clients</b>. And, yes, that is an accurate count.</p>
				
				<h4>Background</h4>
                <p>Sales, boosts, and carries are often associated with Chinese farmers or other various "scams." Unlike those organizations, we are all 100% English speaking American college/university students. Every member of our team is in their 20's and puts almost every dollar they earn into our college tuition or general living expenses. We don't do this to cash in and buy new cars -- this pays our bills; just as any other job does. On top of that, we're experienced in the game. Every member of our team has achieved the highest level of success in the game from Gladiator, Hero of the Horde, to world first PvE kills. We are NOT a random group of players who decided to throw something together for fun. We pride ourselves on our efficiency.</p>
				
				<h4>Security</h4>
                <p>First and foremost, we're honest. We aren't going to lie to you and say this is perfect fine in regards to Blizzard's EULA, because it's not. However, sales, boosts, and carries have been a presence in the game since its incarnation. That said, we take every precaution to keep your account secure. We have been at this for a long time, and can happily report that during this time no client has ever had any action taken against their account. Every team member uses a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to mask their IP address. When streaming, we hide all character names making you invisibile to anyone watching. And, obviously, we never speak about anything related to this service in-game. Additionally, we specifically ask you prior to your run how (or if) to respond to anyone inquiring about you.</p>
            
				<h4>Communication</h4>
				<p>We're undoubtedly the easiest to get in contact with. We have two members of our staff dedicated to answering your questions. Our Skype (wowchallengemodes) and e-mail (contact@wowchallengemodes.com) are being monitored around the clock for questions and comments. The only time you wont receieve a response is when we unfortunately have to sleep!</p>
                
				<h4>Screw the Taboo</h4>
                <p>A lot of people have a negative opinion of our services, and people whom take advantage of it. They just don't quite understand. The reason we rarely use the term "boost" or "carry" is simple: we don't view it that way. In fact, there is rarely ever a case where a player does not pull their own weight. Challenge modes are extremely difficult and time consuming. But, those are not the only factors to consider. Not only do you, yourself have to complete it -- you have to find four other people just as talented and available as you. (And that doesn't even take into account the group composition!) THAT is the difficult part. No one should be subjected to ridicule either directly or indirectly for wanting to save themselves the headache and unimaginable amounts of time of dealing with nightmare groups (or attempting to even START one)!</p>
