							<h2>We were made <strong>by a team</strong> of awesome players and entrepreneurs.</h2>
							<p class="lead">We have been providing boosts since November of 2012 and haven't stopped since.</p>
							<p>We are a team of college students living in the United States, and are all former members of world renowned raiding guilds. In order to focus our time and energy on challenge modes, we quit raiding entirely and now play solely for challenge modes. Early in Mists of Pandaria we realized challenge modes would be one of the toughest additions to the game. Not only are they unforgiving, it's also extremely difficult to find the right group of players to do them with. Why go through the hassle of finding a group when ours is ready to bring you along? We took  that idea and ran with it, and now provide challenge mode boosts on every realm, region, and faction. We're always looking forward to doing challenge modes and meeting new people. If you're interested we hope you'll join us for a run!</p>
