								We get asked a LOT of questions about our service. It's literally impossible for us to cover all of them here, but we'll try! There's a lot of text here, so you can use your web browser's search feature (Ctrl+F for Windows / Command+F for Mac) or the website search feature to better assist in finding what you are looking for.

									<label>How can I trust you?</label>
									<p>We've been in business since November of 2012. Since then we have serviced thousands of buyers (check out the stats page for a real-time, accurate number), and pride ourselves on honesty and providing a high quality service. We are transparent through the entire process. Anytime you want to reach out to us we are available via e-mail, Skype, and even phone. We privately stream the run so you can watch, and you can join us in our Skype call for the run as well. If you want to check us out more you can visit our YouTube page where you'll find videos of us completing all 9 challenge modes on stream a while back (webcams included). You can also check us out of Facebook and Twitter (links at top right of page). There you will find numerous reviews from previous customers in addition to the reviews here.</p>

									<label>After I order, how long do I have to wait?</label>
									<p>Average wait time depends on region, faction, class, and talent specializaiton. Typically it takes about 1-3 days from the time you order until the time we start the run. However, depending demand or what run we're doing that day we may be able to get you in much sooner. We've had many clients purchase and have their order complete within hours.</p>

									<label>What are the requirements to do this?</label>

									<label>Do I have to remove my authenticator? What if I don't have one?</label>
									<p>You don't need to remove your authenticator. You can just give us the code and we'll be able to log in with no problems. If you don't have an authenticator when we try to log in your account will lock as an automatic security feature. This happens anytime you log in from a different IP (even if you were logging in from your next door neighbors house this would happen). You will just need to reset your password through Battle.net and give us the new one then we'll be able to log in.</p>

									<label>How does payment work?</label>
									<p>We use PayPal as our payment merchant, and it's important to note you do NOT need PayPal to order. We never receive any of your financial information. Even though PayPal handles the transaction, as stated before, you do not need an account to place an order. You can simply select checkout as guest and you'll be able to enter in your credit or debit card information and you'll be able to place an order.</p>

									<label>Do you do partial runs?</label>
									<p>No. We only sell full runs. Partial runs create scheduling conflicts so unfortunately we do not offer them.</p>

									<label>Do you guys accept gold or any other method of payment?</label>
									<p>No.</p>

									<label>Do you guys ever offer special discounts?</label>
									<p>All the time! However, we love to be discreet about it. Almost all of our discount codes are posted to those who "like" us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter. Want to save an extra $10, $15, or $20? Head on over to those pages and do that!</p>
